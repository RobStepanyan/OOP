# Module 1/3: Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming - Second Edition

## Chapter 9: The Iterator Pattern

### Design patterns in brief
When engineers and architects decide to build a bridge, or a tower, or a building,
they follow certain principles to ensure structural integrity. There are various
possible designs for bridges (suspension or cantilever, for example), but if the
engineer doesn't use one of the standard designs, and doesn't have a brilliant new
design, it is likely the bridge he/she designs will collapse.

Design patterns are an attempt to bring this same formal definition for correctly
designed structures to software engineering. There are many different design patterns
to solve different general problems. People who create design patterns first identify
a common problem faced by developers in a wide variety of situations. They then
suggest what might be considered the ideal solution for that problem, in terms of
object-oriented design.

In this chapter, we'll be covering the iterator design pattern. This pattern is so powerful
and pervasive that the Python developers have provided multiple syntaxes to access
the object-oriented principles underlying the pattern. We will be covering other design
patterns in the next two chapters. Some of them have language support and some
don't, but none of them is as intrinsically a part of the Python coder's daily life as
the iterator pattern.
